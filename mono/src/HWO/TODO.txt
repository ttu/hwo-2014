Traffic handling

Too many linq queries where result does not change after initialization

If first corner is 22.5 and out with speed 9, then 45 max speed is 4.5 so this wont work

Slowing down in straights is now: as fast as possible and then count when have to drop to 0

Cornering and exit speed calculations (trying to exit even if next piece is same corner) are not really working

Corner InPieceDistance calculations doesn't work correctly (sometimes gives too long traveldistance)
	This might actually be case with pieces that have a switch?
